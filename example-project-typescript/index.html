			<h1>Lapsa: Easy, Elegant Slides</h1>

			<p>Lapsa is the incredibly simple way to build beautiful and interactive presentations. It uses HTML, CSS,
				and JavaScript or TypeScript for its layout and functionality, meaning easy things are easy and nearly anything is
				possible.</p>

			<p>Use the arrow keys, enter, or space to move forward, or swipe up on a touchscreen.</p>
		</div>



		<div>
			<h1>Build and Unbuild with Ease</h1>

			<p class="build">Give elements the <code>.build</code> class to make them appear one at a time...</p>

			<div id="order-demo">
				<p class="build">...or set the <code>data-build</code> attribute to</p>

				<p data-build="3">order</p>

				<p data-build="4">them</p>

				<p data-build="2">yourself.</p>
			</div>
		</div>



		<div>
			<h1>Hassle-Free Navigation</h1>

			<p class="build">Hover over the left edge of the window or swipe right to open the shelf, which contains
				more navigation options.</p>

			<p class="build">Single arrows move a build at a time, double arrows move a whole slide at a time, and the
				middle button opens the table view, which adapts to fit any screen size.</p>
		</div>



		<div id="theme-demonstration">
			<h1>Bring Your Own Code</h1>

			<p class="build">Functional builds mean Lapsa slides are as powerful as you can make them. Your code runs
				when and where you want it, and extra information like target durations lets them look great with
				Lapsa&#x2019;s built-in animations.</p>

			<p class="build">Lapsa is styled with plain and simple CSS, so the default look of the slides is nothing
				more than a suggestion &mdash; and the possibilities really are endless.</p>

			<div class="purple-wave"></div>
			<div class="purple-wave purple-wave-2"></div>
			<div class="purple-wave purple-wave-3"></div>
		</div>



		<div>
			<h1>Portable and Publishable</h1>

			<p class="build">Lapsa has no dependencies and runs just as well locally as on a website, so you can use it
				both to build and present slides on your own and to publish them to the world.</p>

			<p class="build">Lapsa and its documentation is available on GitHub &mdash; the easiest way to get started
				is to download the entire repository and start tinkering with the files under
				<code>/example-project/</code>.
			</p>

			<p data-build="1">Happy Lapsing!</p>
